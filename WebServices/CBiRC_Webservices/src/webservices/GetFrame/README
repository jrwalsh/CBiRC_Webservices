Installation:

1) getFrameSlots and GetFrame.jar must be accessible through a webserver (such as apache2)
2) The webserver must support php pages (mod_php)
3) Users browsing to the getFrameSlots page must have priviledges to run the java call to GetFrame.jar
4) userWebsiteCustomization.js and userWebsiteCustomization.css must be in the [pathway-tools home]/aic-exports/htdocs folder
5) template-beginning-body-dynamic.shtml must also be in the [pathway-tools home]/aic-exports/htdocs folder


Known Issues:
1) Pathway Tools runs AllegroServe webserver.  This webserver does not support php, therefore the getFrameSlots.php file must be served by a php-enables server.

2) Firefox does not like the cross-domain javascript call that allows this service to function.  IE does not seem to have a problem with it.  To enable firefox
support, it might be possible to set up a lisp proxy file that would be served with Pathway Tools in the htdocs folder, and would simply fetch the getFrameSlots.php
webpage and print it back to the calling javascript.

3)Debugging Hints
Test java with
	>java -jar GetFrame.jar host port frame slot

Test php by browsing to getFrameSlots.php with appropriate query values.

Test website by browsing to an object on the pathway tools served webpages.
